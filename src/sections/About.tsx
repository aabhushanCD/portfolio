      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I'm Aabhushan, a passionate Computer Science student and full-stack
        developer focused on building scalable and real-world applications. I
        specialize in backend development using the MERN stack and enjoy
        designing efficient systems that solve practical problems.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I have hands-on experience developing production-ready features,
        including authentication systems, REST APIs, file handling, cloud
        integrations, and database architecture. Currently, I’m building an
        advanced Learning Management System (LMS) that combines academic
        learning, skill-based courses, and interactive features.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Beyond development, I am actively strengthening my knowledge in Data
        Structures & Algorithms, Network Security, and DevOps practices. I
        believe in continuous learning, system thinking, and writing clean,
        maintainable code.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        My goal is to become a highly skilled backend and DevOps engineer who
        builds reliable, secure, and scalable digital products.
